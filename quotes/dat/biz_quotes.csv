"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

"No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.",Steve Jobs

"A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences.

The reason that Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we've always tried to be at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts.,Steve Jobs
"Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn.",Steve Jobs

If you're gonna make connections which are innovative... you have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does.,Steve Jobs

"We've used up a lot of bullets. And we talk about stimulus. But the truth is, we're running a federal deficit that's 9 percent of GDP. That is stimulative as all get out. It's more stimulative than any policy we've followed since World War II.",Warren Buffett
We enjoy the process far more than the proceeds.,Warren Buffett
